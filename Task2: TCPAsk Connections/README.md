Task 2: HTTPEcho Server

For this task, I built an HTTP server that listens for client connections and echoes back any data it receives, formatted as a valid HTTP response. 
The server processes incoming HTTP requests and sends the received content back in the response body with a “200 OK” status.

I implemented the server to handle incoming HTTP requests, parse the data, and send it back in a properly structured HTTP response. 

`TCPAsk.java` – An example Java program that uses the `tcpclient.TCPClient` class.
